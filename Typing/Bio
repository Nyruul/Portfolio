I am a full-stack student enrolled in the Engineering immersion bootcamp at Thinkful. I love problem solving things, reverse engineering the world around me and finding ways to improve
or create new ideas to streamline the environment we share. I am particularly focused on tackling security issues in these environments, and as such this passion manifests itself in 
the direction my work goes.
